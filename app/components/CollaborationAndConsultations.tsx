        With promoting a culture for collaboration and consultations within
        our building company, we prioritise open communication and teamwork
        at every stage of our projects. Our approach values the diverse
        expertise within our team, encouraging seamless coordination between
        architects, engineers and construction professionals. By promoting a
        collaborative environment, we ensure that innovative ideas are
        shared, challenges are addressed collectively and decisions are made
        with a comprehensive understanding of the project's requirements.
        This commitment to collaboration not only enhances efficiency but
        also results in high-quality outcomes that exceed client
        expectations.

        PROJECT MANAGEMENT
      </h2>
      <p className="p">
        Our team at Lush Constructions works collectively with our clients,
        their architect and design team. Along with other trades to
        guarantee we meet the brief to the highest of standards.
      </p>
      <p className="p !py-8">
        As an owner/builder company, from the initial consultation we build
        trusted relationships with our clients. This ensures their
        understanding that they will be dealing with the same people from
        the start to the finish of their project.
      </p>
      <p className="p">
        Throughout the build you will be scheduled onsite meetings during
        various stages of the project as it progresses and evolves. Making
        sure everyone is on the same page or where site constraints may call
        for an alteration in design.
