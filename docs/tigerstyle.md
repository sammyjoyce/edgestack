TigerStyle for TypeScript

The Essence of Style

“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” — Leonardo da Vinci

TigerStyle in TypeScript is an evolving, collective blend of intuition, engineering precision, and developer empathy. It bridges the gap between correctness and expressiveness, readability and rigor, encapsulating the ethos that great code is designed—not merely written.

Why Have Style?

Design isn’t just visual or tactile—it defines how our code operates.

“The design is not just what it looks like and feels like. The design is how it works.” — Steve Jobs

Our design goals are clear: safety and developer experience. Good style serves these goals, reinforcing clarity, predictability, and ease of understanding. Code should naturally communicate intent, minimize error, and optimize the cognitive load on developers.

Simplicity and Elegance

Simplicity isn’t easy—it demands effort, iteration, and discipline. It is the hardest revision, not the initial draft.

“Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard work and discipline to achieve.” — Edsger Dijkstra

Investing time upfront in simplifying code and systems reaps exponential returns during development, testing, and maintenance phases. Simpler systems tend to be more reliable, faster to implement, and easier to maintain.

Zero Technical Debt

Code, like steel, is easier to shape while hot. Address issues immediately and decisively. We hold a zero tolerance policy towards technical debt.

“You shall not pass!” — Gandalf

Shipping fewer, robust features is preferable to shipping many features poorly. Reliable code builds momentum and fosters pride.

Safety

Safety in TypeScript relies heavily on rigorous use of the type system and runtime checks:
	•	Enable strict type checks; minimize use of any.
	•	Write explicit control flow—avoid unbounded recursion and ambiguous logic.
	•	Limit and explicitly handle resources like loops, promises, and async tasks.
	•	Assert extensively at runtime to catch invalid states early. Use at least two assertions per function to verify both input and output invariants.
	•	Maintain immutability wherever feasible to minimize side effects and accidental state mutations.
	•	Structure functions to minimize complexity—no function should exceed approximately 70 lines.

Performance

Performance is a design-time consideration. It must be addressed proactively rather than retroactively:
	•	Prioritize performance based on actual bottlenecks: network > disk I/O > memory > CPU.
	•	Use quick, “back-of-the-envelope” calculations to guide initial performance considerations.
	•	Batch operations to amortize resource overhead.
	•	Write predictable, consistent code to leverage compiler and engine optimizations.
	•	Always measure and profile performance—don’t rely on guesswork or compiler “magic”.

Developer Experience

Code is read more often than it’s written. Great developer experience means:
	•	Choosing names that clearly express intent without unnecessary abbreviations.
	•	Writing code that’s logically organized, predictable, and consistent.
	•	Maintaining a single source of truth—avoid parallel hierarchies or redundant state.
	•	Minimizing scope and managing side-effects carefully, clearly signaling them in code.
	•	Documenting decisions and rationale in clear, professional prose.
	•	Relying on tooling (linters, formatters, CI) to enforce consistency and catch issues early.

Testing Philosophy

Testing is integral—not supplemental. Great tests:
	•	Cover both valid and invalid scenarios exhaustively, explicitly testing negative space.
	•	Utilize assertions generously to verify correctness.
	•	Include both focused unit tests and holistic integration tests.
	•	Ensure tests remain deterministic, fast, and independent.
	•	Continuously validate correctness with assertions in production environments.

Tooling and Dependencies

Avoid unnecessary dependencies—each added package introduces complexity and potential vulnerabilities. Use standard libraries and minimalistic tools. The best tool often is the one already in hand.

“The right tool for the job is often the tool you are already using—adding new tools has a higher cost than many people appreciate.” — John Carmack

Final Thoughts

TigerStyle in TypeScript is about cultivating a disciplined yet expressive coding ethos. Write software that’s clear, robust, minimal, and maintainable. The result will be code that not only performs well but remains enjoyable and intuitive to work with, today and tomorrow.
