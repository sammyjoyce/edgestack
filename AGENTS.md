# Contributor Notes

This repository is being transformed into a reusable template. Any remaining content specific to **Lush Constructions** should be removed or generalized.

When updating code or documentation:
- Replace project-specific branding with generic placeholders.
- Keep examples and starter data minimal so the repository can be forked easily for new projects.

There are no mandatory checks for this repo, but maintainers should run `bun run format` before committing to keep the codebase consistent.
